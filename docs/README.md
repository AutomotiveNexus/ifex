# VSC Documentation Overview

## Reading

These documents are available:

- Overall specification, including introductory and explaining chapters, plus the formal syntax of the core IDL/model: [vsc-specification.md](./vsc-specification.md)
- Tips and information for developers: [developers-manual.md](./developers-manual.md)

# Developing / generating

Documentation is generated by a combination of tools and steps:

- [Github actions workflow](/.github/workflows/generate_documentation.yml) encodes the build steps.
- [markup-markdown](https://github.com/hailiang-wang/markup-markdown) is used to combine several markdown files into one.  Some markdown files are static and stored in [[doc-parts]], whereas some are generated from source files.
- vsc_ast_doc.py generates `syntax.md` from the formal definition of the IDL.  The definition is directly in this python source file: [vsc_ast.py](vsc/model/vsc_ast.py)
- [specification.m.md](./specification.m.md) and [developers-manual.m.md](./developers-manual.m.md) define the structure of the final documents.  These files are processed by **markup-markdown** tool.
- The GitHub actions workflow goes on to publish the results of the docs directory to the gh-pages branch, which makes it visible at [https://covesa.github.io/vsc-tools](https://covesa.github.io/vsc-tools)
